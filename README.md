# Greetings!

I’m **Saima**, a **Full Stack software development student** at Helsinki Business College. I’m a career changer, which means my journey as a coder is still at an early stage, but my passion for learning and my strong work ethic drive me swiftly forward. In my studies, I focus on web technologies such as **React** and **Java**, and I’m comfortable working in both Finnish and English.

To further improve, I eagerly take on challenging projects that allow me to learn as much as possible. Each project brings me closer to becoming a professional, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.

## 🔧 Skills

My studies and project-focused work have built a solid foundation in these areas:

- 🌐 **Front-end**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React
- 🖥️ **Back-end**: Java, Spring Boot
- 🗄️ **Tietokannat**: SQL, H2 Database, database structures
- 🔄 **Versionhallinta**: Git & GitHub
- 🎨 **UI/UX-suunnittelu**: Figma, prototyping

Through various school projects, I’ve gained loads of hands-on experience, and my love for programming grows with each new challenge. I get the most joy when I get to develop efficient solutions to complex problems.

## 📚 Projects

Here are a few examples of projects where I’ve applied my skills over the past 9 months:

#### [ShareVault app](https://github.com/esapuolakka/shareholder.git)

This project is an ongoing group work for our course, which we’re building as a team of four. The app is designed for managing a shareholder registry, making it easy for companies to manage shareholder information and stock transactions. ShareVault includes features like managing a shareholder list, tracking stock sales and purchases, and visual charts for stock value development. Users can view ownership shares, sort data in tables, and get real-time shareholder information. The app is built using React and the Highcharts library for creating visual charts. The backend is developed with Spring Boot. I’m responsible for the front-end development with another classmate, and the design and style are my own creation.
